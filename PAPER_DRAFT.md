# DNA-Net: Day-Night Adaptive Deraining Network

## Abstract

We propose DNA-Net (Day-Night Adaptive Deraining Network), a unified deep learning framework that effectively handles both daytime and nighttime image deraining. Unlike existing methods that specialize in either day or night conditions, DNA-Net adaptively combines two complementary approaches: (1) Rain Location Prior (RLP) with Rain Prior Injection Module (RPIM) for nighttime deraining, excelling at locating and removing rain in low-light conditions, and (2) Bidirectional Multiscale Transformer with Implicit Neural Representations (INR) for daytime deraining, effectively modeling complex rain patterns across scales. Our key innovation is an Illumination-Aware Fusion Module that automatically detects scene lighting conditions and dynamically weights each branch accordingly. Through extensive experiments on both daytime and nighttime deraining benchmarks, DNA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating XX.XX dB PSNR improvement on nighttime datasets and XX.XX dB on daytime datasets compared to specialized methods.

## 1. Introduction

Image deraining is a fundamental low-level vision task with applications in autonomous driving, surveillance, and outdoor photography. While significant progress has been made in daytime deraining, nighttime deraining remains challenging due to:

1. **Low illumination** reducing visibility and SNR
2. **Complex light interactions** between rain and artificial light sources
3. **Varying rain appearance** at different scales and lighting conditions

### Limitations of Existing Methods

- **Daytime-focused methods** (e.g., NeRD-Rain) fail in low-light conditions
- **Nighttime-focused methods** (e.g., RLP) may not fully exploit multi-scale information
- No unified framework handles both conditions adaptively

### Our Contributions

1. **Unified Architecture**: First framework combining RLP and multiscale Transformer with INR for both day and night deraining
2. **Illumination-Aware Fusion**: Novel adaptive fusion module with illumination estimation and cross-attention
3. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Superior results on both day and night benchmarks
4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Ablation studies validating each component

### 3.1 Overall Architecture

DNA-Net consists of four main components:

```
Input → Illumination Estimator → [RLP Branch]    → Adaptive Fusion → Output
                                  [NeRD Branch]
```

### 3.2 Illumination Estimator

   - Different depths and heads per scale
   - Bidirectional information flow

2. **Implicit Neural Representation (INR)**

   - Captures complementary information

2. **Illumination-Conditioned Gating**
   - Channel-wise gates from (w_night, w_day)
   - MLP: 2 → 64 → 128 → 2C

3. **Spatial Gating**
